# Java Roguelike Game

## Intro
My first full project using Java, silly little thing but it can be fun to play.
There are three basic classses you choose from, once you pick one, you fight a series of battles until you are strong enough to beat the final boss.


## The classes
You will be given a choice to play as one of three classes and to name your here

**Juggernaut:** This class is has very high defense but low attack. Their moves are focused more around absorbing damage rather than dishing it out.

**Barbarian:** This class is focused on dealing as much damage as possible. They can carry two weapons and are able to lower their defense just to do more damage.

**Knight:** This class is a nice all rounder with on exception. They're RICH!!!. They start the game with extra money and will always have more than the others. Good thing they can use that gold in battle...


## Combat
This game is turn-based. Each turn you choose an attack to use. Once your turn is complete, you will always attack before the enemy. 
Damage is determined via your weapon damage multiplied by your strength. The highest damage any weapon can deal is 15.
You can also choose to block, block is calculated by mutiplying your defense by your weapon's block value. This will be subtracted from the enemy's attack!

## Rest Area
Between combat you can take a break at the rest area. Here you can buy potions and drink them. The potion shop has an assortment of potions necessary for you to become stronger.
Once you have drunk you potions, you can head back into battle and fight either the final boss or go into another regular fight!

## The enemies
There are several enemies you may face
*Orc: A strong enemy who doesnt have much health but does loads of damage.
*Goblin: An all rounder.
*Troll: Has loads of health but does little damage
*Imp: Has little health and damage. An easy battle.

## Extras
This entire project was developed in BlueJ, not the most amazing IDE, but its got some cool features. 
The use of BlueJ will also explain the extra little features shown here and there, have fun!
